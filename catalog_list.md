## A (non-exhaustive) list of binary catalogs for Gaia/TGAS

### Eclipsing Binaries

Kepler Eclipsing Binary Catalog: http://keplerebs.villanova.edu/

* Original Kepler mission (324 in TGAS)
* K2 (145 in TGAS)

Other sources

* DEBcat: compilation of well-studied detached EBs: http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/jkt/debcat/
* CoRoT
* MOST
* Ground-based surveys (OGLE, MACHO, WASP, KELT, PTF, MEarth)
* *Future:*  Gaia light curves


### Spectroscopic Binaries

* SB9 (The Ninth Catalogue of Spectroscopic Binaries): http://sb9.astro.ulb.ac.be/

### Common Proper Motion Binaries

### Astrometric Binaries

Visual binaries: each component can be resolved - either  and the orbit measured directly. Limited to nearby systems.

* Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars: http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astrometry/optical-IR-prod/wds/orb6

Unresolved binaries: The binary orbit will cause a perturbation of the photocenter, from which the orbit can be modeled.

* RECONS?
* *Future:* Gaia
